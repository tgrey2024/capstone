## Overview
Reminineez is a Django-based digital scrapbook app that allows authenticated users to create individualised scrapbooks of photos, songs, etc for seniors with problems with memory and/or language, to serve as a memory aid as part of their reminiscence therapy. Research has shown that personalised memory aids can significantly improve the quality and quantity of conversations with carers and loved ones, stimulate neural connections and enhances self-esteem and wellbeing. Conversations about the past can also help to bring the family closer and build stronger bonds.

## User Experience Design Process
<p align="right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
## Project Brief
<p align="right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
## Users
Seniors with Memory and/or Language Problems: These are the primary users for whom the app is designed. These seniors may be dealing with conditions such as dementia or other cognitive impairments. The app aims to enhance their quality of life by providing a personalised digital space where they can compile cherished photos, favourite songs, newspaper articles, videos and other memory aids. This resource serves as a valuable tool to help them recall significant events, personal stories, maintain cognitive function and engage more actively with their surroundings. Colour blindness, in particular colour vision deterioration e.g. tritanopia ("blue-yellow" colour blindness) is also common in those aged 70 and over.

Carers and Loved Ones: These users include family members, friends and caregivers who interact with the seniors on a daily basis. They may be helping the seniors to use the app to create, update and manage the individual memory books/blogs for their loved ones, or they may be the ones creating the blogs on behalf of the seniors. By incorporating familiar and beloved content, they can improve the quality and quantity of their conversations with the seniors. This process not only helps to strengthen emotional bonds but also provides carers with insights into the senior's life story, enabling more empathetic and tailored care.

Developer/Admin: This superuser is responsible for developing, maintaining and updating the web app. They ensure the app is functional, secure, user friendly and handles any user support and content issues.

### Mockup
  - [Canva Mockup](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGbzmo_8Iw/GjNxoK5LvaTmJT1r-8IEiQ/view?utm_content=DAGbzmo_8Iw&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=hf37b8eca3e)
- **Design Rationale:**
  - [Explain key design decisions, such as layout, colour scheme, typography, and how accessibility guidelines (e.g., WCAG) were integrated.]
  - [Highlight any considerations made for users with disabilities, such as screen reader support.]
- **Reasoning For Any Final Changes:**
  - [Summarise significant changes made to the design during development and the reasons behind them.]

## Key Features
- **Feature 1:** [Briefly describe the implemented feature.]
- **Feature 2:** [Briefly describe the implemented feature.]
- **Inclusivity Notes:** 
  - [Mention how the features address the needs of diverse users, including those with SEND.]
<p align="right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

## Deployment
- **Platform:** [Platform used, e.g., Heroku, AWS, etc.]


- **High-Level Deployment Steps:** 
  1. [Step 1]
  2. [Step 2]
  3. [Step 3]
  The [Code Institute Template] (https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/ci-full-template) was used to create the GitHub repository, so that the website could be developed in the correct setup of Gitpod IDE.

The GitHub Copilot extension was also installed in my local client version of MS VS Code, which was also connected with the same GitHub repository and linked to Gitpod via SSH. This allows for AI pair programming in the initial stages of development to create certain sections faster.

The process is as follows:
1. Login to your GitHub profile.
2. Go to the [Code Institute Template] (https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/ci-full-template).
3. Click **Use this template** and then **Create a new repository**.
4. Enter the repo name and choose to create from template
5. Click **Open** with the Gitpod logo to open the Code Institute IDE workspace.
6. Open VS Code locally and click on Gitpod logo on the left. Click on right arrow next to the workspace you want to work on.
 
Once the MVP has been created in Gitpod, go to GitHub Pages to make an early deployment of the project, so that testing can be done in Dev Tools to highlight key issues that need to be resolve early on in the project.
- **Verification and Validation:**
  - Steps taken to verify the deployed version matches the development version in functionality.
  - [Include any additional checks to ensure accessibility of the deployed application.]
- **Security Measures:**
  - Use of environment variables for sensitive data.
  - Ensured DEBUG mode is disabled in production.

## AI Implementation and Orchestration

### Use Cases and Reflections:
(Highlight how prompts, such as reverse, question-and-answer or multi-step, were used to support learners with SEND or ALN where relevant.)

  - **Code Creation:** 
    - Reflection: Strategic use of AI allowed for rapid prototyping, with minor adjustments for alignment with project goals. 
    - Examples: Reverse prompts for alternative code solutions and question-answer prompts for resolving specific challenges.
  - **Debugging:** 
    - Reflection: Key interventions included resolving logic errors and enhancing maintainability, with a focus on simplifying complex logic to make it accessible.
  - **Performance and UX Optimization:** 
    - Reflection: Minimal manual adjustments were needed to apply AI-driven improvements, which enhanced application speed and user experience for all users.
  - **Automated Unit Testing:**
    - Reflection: Adjustments were made to improve test coverage and ensure alignment with functionality. Prompts were used to generate inclusive test cases that considered edge cases for accessibility.

- **Overall Impact:**
  - AI tools streamlined repetitive tasks, enabling focus on high-level development.
  - Efficiency gains included faster debugging, comprehensive testing, and improved code quality.
  - Challenges included contextual adjustments to AI-generated outputs, which were resolved effectively, enhancing inclusivity.
